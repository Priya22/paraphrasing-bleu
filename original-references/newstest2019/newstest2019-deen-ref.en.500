to become "The Beauty of Munich" in 2018!
In the afternoon there is another surprise waiting for our contestants: they will be competing for the romantic candlelight photo shoot at MY SOLARIS not alone, but together with a male-model Fabian!
Hvar with its flirting, coquetting, and seduction is not an easy task for our girls.
Especially when there is a boyfriend waiting in Germany.
Despite dealing with wind, sprays and rain, the nine contestants of "The Beauty of Munich" behaved like real professionals at the photo shoot with People-photographer Tuan.
You may watch the romantic photoshoot on the video:
The president of DFB Grindel sees no basis for the returning of Özil
Berlin - The president of DFB Reinhard Grindel sees no basis for the returning of Mesut Özil to the national team.
There is an open question so you get into a conversation, you talk to him about why you have apparently felt that way, how is stated in his statement, said Grindel in football Podcast "Phrasenmäher" of the newspaper "Bild-Zeitung".
In spite of the debate going on for months about the photos of Özil with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the return of the 92-match national player Özil.
I would be happy if Mesut Özil continued to play for Germany.
At some point of time I also assumed that it will happen, said Grindel.
The 29-year-old had declared that he quits DFB team in July and explained it with the fact that Grindel did not protect him against racist hostility during the World Cup.
The DFB head repeated his criticism of Özil and that he is not ready for a discussion with national coach and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He did not want to create any pressure, but he knows that in football ‘if you leave a team or change club, you talk to your trainer and I think it is sad that this discussion did not happen before’.
Linz: Garden shed in allotment gardens burnt down
At 14.13 the Linz professional fire department was notified of a fire in Angererhofweg.
As a high-voltage power line directly traverses the allotment garden, danger was imminent.
The professional fire brigade drove out and on arrival found the hut fully in flames.
The roof had to be almost completely removed and the huge amount of debris needed clearing.
The owner of the burning garden hut stated that at noon he had connected a battery to the power supply for charging.
This was the possible cause of the fire.
According to the fire department the loading unit was in the most intensive area of the fire.
The damage caused by the fire, and the cause of the fire, still needs to be investigated.
The damage could be considerable as the owner stored many collectibles in his garden hut.
Angry mother defends herself: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on the street
What provoked Lindsay Lohan to such very strange actions?
She apparently wanted to lure the children away from the alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, ‘Herbie: Fully Loaded’) has live streamed how she openly wanted to tear children away from a family in Moscow.
This was reported by US portal "TMZ" with publication of a partial recording of the stream.
Here you can see the "Just My Luck" with Lindsay Lohan
In the clip you can see how Lohan gets out of a car and goes up to a possibly homeless family, identified as a refugee family from Syria.
As the family flee in front of the actress, Lohan follows the parents and their children.
She accuses the adults of child trafficking.
Yet she does not offer any proof in the clip.
The whole world is watching, says Lohan in the video as she follows the family further down the street.
She seems to try to separate the children from their parents.
At some point, however, it seems that the obviously angry mother had it enough.
It looks as if they turn around and Lohan gets a slap in the face.
In tears, the actress protests about how shocked she is - holding her cheek.
What provoked Lindsay Lohan to such very strange actions is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: These are "Mascot's" tasks on the asteroid
The “Hayabusa2” probe launched in December 2014 in Japan.
It should get so close to the asteroid Ryugu that it can suck in material from its surface and bring it back to Earth.
The lander “Mascot” will remain on Ryugu.
International news ticker: Number of dead in Sulawesi rises to more than 400
After the severe magnitude 7.5 earthquake and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, there are reports of at least 420 casualties.
Reportedly, the number of victims could rise even further.
The rescue teams have not yet progressed into the ravaged and isolated areas.
Elon Musk resigns as Tesla chairman
In the beginning, there was a tweet.
Tesla boss Elon Musk caused nervousness on the stock markets in early August when he announced a withdrawal by the electric car manufacturer.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission sued him for fraud, but the parties have now agreed to a settlement.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and the Tesla boss steps down as chairman, but he may remain as CEO.
The British Conservative Party Conference
Under tight security - the Tory party conference
Birmingham becomes the stage for a power struggle.
The party conference was to address foreign policy, trade issues and development policy, but the four-day conference was overshadowed by the conflict between Prime Minister, Theresa May and the Brexit hardliners, with ex-Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson in the frontline.
Referendum for a new state name
The foreign ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have reached agreement
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in Northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing about the duplicate name for years.
Now they have come to an agreement.
In future, the state of Macedonia is to be called North Macedonia and the population will vote on this measure on Sunday from the population - will it turn out okay?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populist Bolsonaro.
Ele Nao ("Not him") - addressed to Jair Bolsonaro.
One week before the presidential election in Brazil and the mood in the country is divided.
In many cities thousands are taking to the street to protest against the right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The ‘Brazilian Trump’ is presenting himself as an anti-system candidate and is ahead in the polls.
His keenest competitor is Fernando Haddad from the left workers’ party.
Audi: "Dieselgate" regeneration takes longer than planned
There is still a diesel taskforce, said Peter Mertens, chief development officer from the ‘Automobilwoche’ trade journal.
In December 2017 the imprisoned and suspended Audi CEO Rupert Stadler had announced, the taskforce will be dissolved soon.
In the first quarter of 2018 all engine/transmission combinations will have been checked, he said at the time.
Mertens now says: ‘At the start of July we have an important milestone by which the diesel crisis will have been worked out.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The taskforce was set up in September 2015 following the discovery at Audi parent company Volkswagen.
Mertens highlighted that the automobile manufacturers had made ‘serious, organizational changes’, to prevent such a scandal ever happening again.
The VW Supervisory Board had postponed a decision on Stadler's future on Friday and will continue this discussion on Tuesday.
The investigating authorities accuse the Audi boss, following awareness of exhaust emission cheating, of permitting the sale of diesel automobiles with false emission values.
He must have known about the tampering or deliberately ignored it.
Currently the Sales Director Bram Schot heads the company as Acting Chief Executive Officer.
After conversion to the new emissions and consumption standard WLTP, there were production losses at Audi, Schot told the ‘Heilbronner Stimme’.
Essentially, he sees a falling demand for limousines such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8, produced in Neckarsulm.
The segment in itself is a difficult one, he said.
Schot is for electromobility.
There are already 15,000 reservations for the e-tron, the first Audi electric automobile.
Grindel seeking re-election - Lahm to join the Presidential Board of the German football association (DFB)
Mainz (dpa) - Despite the criticism directed at him personally following the early FIFA World Cup exit and the scandal around Mesut Özil, Reinhard Grindel wants to run for office as President of the DFB again in the coming year.
I do my work and try to make it as good as it gets, said Grindel as a guest early Sunday morning on ZDF’s weekly sports broadcast "Das aktuelle Sportstudio".
A re-election should be attempted and that is what I will do.
And then you have to see what kind of support you get.
In his own words, the head of the association would find it "strange" if he did not "feel like working on the future project" after Germany was awarded the UEFA European Football Championship 2024.
Since April 2016, Grindel has been the head of the association as successor to Wolfgang Niersbach, who had to resign amidst the scandals surrounding the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany.
In autumn 2016 he was elected for a first full term of three years.
The next vote will be held at the DFB’s national conference on September 27, 2019.
According to Grindel, the future head organizer of the 2024 European Football Championship in Germany, Philipp Lahm, is to join the DFB Presidential Board.
I would be pleased if my colleagues on the presidential board agreed that he will continue to provide advice on the board in this role and then of course we very much invite him to share his experience in sporting matters, said Grindel.
At the same time, he did not want to speculate as to whether or not Lahm could succeed him as head of the DFB.
As a consequence of the scandal over the photos taken by Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed a preference for a national team player without an immigration background to fill the position of DFB ambassador for integration.
Currently, this position is filled by native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who traces her family back to Cameroon.
If somebody without a migration background is an obvious influencer in society and football and says, ‘the issue is an important one, we need to do something about it’, ‘this would also be an initiative to provide a better foundation for our local teams, where integration needs to work’, Grindel said.
Losing weight the right way with semi-smart scales
I have owned a new toy for four weeks now.
Scales that weigh my body fat percentage as well as my weight.
Even muscle and bone mass can be displayed.
This thing also calculates my body mass index but that is rather useless anyway.
After all, it does not tell me whether I have been replacing fat with muscle.
Basketball Bundesliga: Clear success for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin started the new German Basketball League season with a sound victory.
Against Science City Jena, the runner-up won easily with 112-55 (52-31) over 40 minutes in a very exciting game.
New addition Rokas Giedraitis was the top scorer of the dominating Berlin team with 20 points.
The international Johannes Thiemann from Ludwigsburg (18 points) also showed off his performance in front of 9113 spectators at his competitive debut.
Ex-champion Brose Bamberg won coach Ainars Bagatskis’ competitive debut with 84-80 (39-37) at s.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was the best scorer of the visitors with 24 points.
Würzburg professional Gabriel Olaseni scored 14 points.
Last year’s playoff semi-finalist MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg defeated the Fraport Skyliners from Frankfurt 83:76 (41:34).
New international Karim Jallow was the most accurate thrower with 24 points in coach John Patrick’s team .
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg began the new season successfully.
Basketball Löwen Braunschweig had a clear victory with 100:64 (48:30) and the first two points.
The new playmaker Will Cummings dominated the Oldenburg team with 25 points.
The Braunschweig team, in which NBA star Dennis Schröder has been the majority owner since the season started, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26-1 run tells it all.
Erdoğan opens mosque in Cologne
The Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
During his three-day state visit, Erdoğan met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to extradite adherents of the Gülen movement living in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens wherever they live.
We will not allow sympathizers of the PKK or Gülen movement to unsettle our citizens and damage the German/Turkish friendship’, he said.
Inner city Cologne was partially blocked for the opening of the Ditib mosque.
Many thousands of police were deployed, including snipers.
The Ditib Islamic association is under criticism because it is seen as an extended arm of the Turkish government.
Global Citizen Festival: Music against poverty: Stars, boos and scary moments
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B campaigned for more engagement in the fight against poverty and illness at a collective concert in New York’s Central Park.
Get involved wherever you can, said Mendes on Sunday evening at the festival in front of approximately 60,000 spectators.
Thank you for coming, this is a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with tassels and a gold microphone.
I am nervous, I am sweating, but it’s OK because I’m here and ready to change the world.
Even actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, government representatives, the United Nations and aid organizations appeared on the stage at the spectacle, which lasted for hours.
There was a scary moment when many spectators mistook the noise of a falling metal barrier for shots, got scared and tried to run away.
There was a short panic with people running in all directions.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, said organizer Hugh Evans.
The New York police and musician Chris Martin calmed the audience from the stage.
Nobody is trying to injure anyone, said Martin.
You are all safe.
As every year, tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available free of charge online.
If you wanted to get one, you had to read and share texts, photos and videos about the global fight against poverty and diseases online.
For the numerous musicians and actors there were cheers and applause from the audience - by contrast, Republican Senator Jeff Flake was booed.
Flake did join his Democratic colleague Chris Coons on the stage in calling for more equal rights between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake had spoken in the Judiciary Committee of the US Senate supporting the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a judge on the Supreme Court, which offended many women.
At least three women made abuse allegations, including some of attempted rape against Kavanaugh, who rejects these.
Flake called for an FBI investigation after two women who reportedly experienced sexual assault themselves confronted him on the way to a committee meeting in an elevator.
You are welcome to join me in an elevator anytime, Flake said to the crowd at the New York concert.
Freedom of Press: Federal government defends exclusion of journalist
Government spokesperson Steffen Seibert has defended the expulsion of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the chancellery, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had put on a T-shirt with the Turkish and German writing “Freedom for journalists” and was sitting in the first row.
The T-shirt was not the problem, Seibert said to the Bild on Sunday.
It was about a disruption in the course of the press conference.
The journalist’s action created a lot of unrest, which was unacceptable.
Thus, he ordered bodyguards to escort the man out.
Seibert said that it was not permitted to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the federal chancellery.
no matter if it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
In Turkey, many journalists are imprisoned.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage or supporting or being members of prohibited parties or the Fethullah Gülen movement.
The Turkish government holds the movement responsible for the failed attempted coup on July 15, 2016.
Some of the accused journalists are facing several decades in jail.
Even foreign journalists are not safe from Turkish authorities: At the beginning of September, the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested.
Most recently, the cases of the incarcerated journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel caused a stir.
They were released and were able to return to Germany, but the legal processes in Turkey against the two are still ongoing.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
His fans normally know him to be so fresh and good looking: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look twice, though: Yes, that's really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and he had a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show “Inas Nacht” [Ina's Night] produced by NDR is known for its cheery conversations at the bar of the Hamburg port pub “Schellfischposten.”
Moderator Ina Müller often cheers her guests with a beer, some wine or even stronger beverages to loosen up the mood and their tongues.
Quite a few celebs also need the liquid courage for the obligatory vocal number.
Another episode of the popular talk show was recorded on Friday.
This time: The actor Florian David Fitz known from films like "Männerherzen", "Terror - Ihr Urteil" or "Der geilste Tag".
The trip didn’t do the actor any good, though.
On Saturday, he posted a selfie - his face completely crumpled, only two small slits for eyes.
The bed selfie showed a completely drained Florian David Fitz.
But he is not ill, he only has quite a hangover.
Addressing his fans, he posted some - probably not entirely serious - insights he learnt: "Rule one: NEVER go to Inas Night.
Rule two: Never drink "die schwarze Sau".
And Spritz.
And also pass on Ina’s round of eggnog at half past two."
The long night is really showing on the 43-year-olds’ face.
His fans posted a couple of tips for getting rid of a hangover.
They ranged from instant broth, fish sandwiches or - probably the most effective - painkillers.
Others simply enjoyed the sight of the normally attractive movie star.
We still don't know how Ina Müller survived the binge drinking at night.
Since she has hosted the wild TV fun at the bar since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much better prepared...
Out for a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has struggled against vandalism and garbage
Accessing the 36-kilometer cycle track in Rotkäppchenland in Treysa is very difficult and heavily littered.
Attempts are made to remedy the rampant vandalism, but there are hardly any signs of solutions.
Shards, cigarette butts, garbage and rubbish, demolished rubbish bins and now dismantled signs - so for quite some time presents itself the entrance with seating area to the bike path on the Haaße-hill in Treysa.
The sight of the bicycle path, which is the flagship object in Rotkäpchenland, is more than inglorious.
The matter is of concern to the ADFC (German Cyclists Association) chapter Schwalmstadt, but others have also taken interest for some time, according to the city's cycling commissioner Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem has already been addressed by the bicycle traffic advisory body.
There is no solution so far.
Suggestions ranged from transferring the seating area to the regular emptying of garbage cans, and cleaning the point of entry areas.
I think, the latter would be the order of the day, irrespective of any further activities, says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) says he also brought the issue up with the local advisory council.
Not only the rubbish is a nuisance for cyclists and residents - on weekends the seating group is a regular meeting place for partying.
It is not just about the noise, there are also disturbances due to parties: Posts pulled out of the ground, garbage cans wrecked, signs snapped and seating daubed.
Frequently volunteers have already cleaned up, explains the ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
Actions are only proverbial drops in the ocean.
They are annoyed that the rest area at the cycle track in Treysa is a meeting point for binge-drinking.
Clearly the focus point along the entire bike path is here on the Haaße, confirms the cycling commissioner, who now is also responsible for the cycling site in Ziegenhain, which will be opened today.
If it suffers the same fate, it will cost dearly.
Another idea is placing video surveillance on the hill: "Possibly this raises the threshold to engage in damaging common property.
However, this would require a police patrol to come out.
In principle, Wüstenhagen supports the development of the Haaße hill.
It needs to be made more attractive.
So far one can be very satisfied with how well the bicycle path is frequented.
It is still possible to develop tourism-related marketing.
Our cycle track is of very high quality compared to others in German’, agreed the ADFC members.
ADFC member Susanne Klippert considers the situation in the Ascheröder Strasse in Treysa to be critically dangerous.
There is no turning lane on Haaße Hügel.
In heavy traffic, cyclists may end up waiting in the middle of bidirectional traffic flows", she explains.
That would not be a problem for sporty cyclists, but is for older people and especially for children.
Music contest at the culture train station: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the sea
The first call to participate in the music contest was a success, creative and cooperative.
Your Song for Hiltrup is the motto of the Hiltrup initiative for the "Music Contest for young and old, new and experienced musicians."
A contest "with a wink from the lovely Hiltrup family", as Karl Franke worded it.
In fact, it soon became a familial togetherness with coffee and cake from the volunteers of the Kulturbahnhof.
Seven acts performed, from a one-man band to the big ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with his guitar, Rolf Ihmig, an old-established Hiltrup man, the "Hiltruper Sternfarben", three members from three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the kindergarten Lummerland and finally Rike Weßling und die Zwarties.
This contest is a novelty, explains district mayor Joachim Schmidt.
We have not seen something like this in other districts.
What did the songwriters sing about?
Particularly popular places were the Hiltrup lake and Marktallee.
Rolf Ihmig dedicated the song to the avenue Marktalle in his folk-like song "Kö von Hiltrup".
The Kulturbahnhof was also mentioned.
Over and over again, the acts sang about experiencing togetherness in these places, especially Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke led the audience through the breaks with short interviews with the performers or some information about the artists.
Thus, the audience learnt that Humberg that he had actually studied chemistry, but now also teaches guitar.
From the sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann Franke reported that he had recently performed in Ludwigshafen - at a major BASF event with Barclay James Harvest as a main act.
And Alvin Jasic has uploaded a lot of YouTube videos.
It’s not about winning, Franke had said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from Hiltrup catering businesses.
For the jury's favorites there was something special - so that others could also hear their songs.
Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied can record an entire CD with sound technician Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Ihmig with his Hiltrup hit, which especially impressed Franke with his musicality, and the “Lummerland pack:” “a very good performance” with ten children and two teachers on guitar and cajón, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone else, the children also performed again for the finals - and even without electronic support, they sounded "really good," Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, catchiness of the melody and recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller from the Westphalian School of Music, Andreas Klomfaß from KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Trade Association as well as Jan Kaven, chairman of the district offensive.
The district offensive launched the event on the occasion of its ten-year anniversary.
They considered the event a complete success.
Everyone was "very satisfied," and "the atmosphere was good" in the very crowded Kulturbahnhof.
The Word Game: Testing "Decrypto"
The players form two teams and sit opposite one another.
For each page there is a screen, on it there are four cards with keywords that you can decipher - the old trick with the red foil.
This ensures the other side cannot read anything unintentionally.
For example, on the cards it says to read from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
2. Fenster.
3. Cube.
4. Solidʺ.
These are the terms that need to be coded.
So the terms are not guessed, the codes are.
Taking turns, one player per team is the encryptor.
They get a code card that has "3.4.2." etc. written on it.
In "Decrypto," it is not the words behind the secret film that should be guessed, but their encryption codes.
The task in this case: They should - in this order and in this example - describe the terms "cube", "solid" and "window" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team does not, because the team that cracks the code twice wins the game.
The encryptor writes down and reads aloud: "Throw" for the dice, "loose" as opposed to "solid". Of course, something like "evidence" would be possible or "Prague" because he read some history books and knows about the defenestration of Prague.
This then progresses, round for round, team by team.
It is true that one does not know the terms of the other side - but with every clue the encryptor gives, you’re closer to finding them out.
So the term should be as mysterious as possible, but not too crazy. Otherwise, you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
The most cryptic ‘Decrypto’ is the precept unfortunately.
The players have to study it for quite a long time and in detail, until they can finally play it.
The explanatory video under decrypto.info on the web will make it easier.
But once you have started, you’ll be amazed at how much emotion there is in this nondescript game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not quite as conclusive as its predecessor and genre-primus "Codenames", which also makes use of the spy theme for a game with few words, but it’s much easier to play in small groups.
And if it's all about guessing and not about winning, it's easy to play a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man gives police the Hitler salute and harasses guests in the pub
During the night from Saturday to Sunday a 48 year old man gave the police station in Kulmbach twice something to do.
First he showed the Hitler salute to a passing police patrol in the upper town, later he was also found in the upper town in a pub where he harassed other guests.
After clearly under the influence of alcohol he did not comply with the police order to vacate the premises, he had to spend the night in the detention cell in the police station of Kulmbach.
In the sober state, he also had to take legal responsibility for the use of symbols of unconstitutional organisations.
The Pressig depotwas home to the thrust locomotives
For decades the depot in Pressig was the hub of the Franconian Forest.
1991 put an end to a piece of railway history.
The crashing from bumper to bumper could be heard throughout Pressig, remembers Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the stations.
This did not bother anybody.
The squeaking of brakes and rattling of carriages could also be heard.
This was pure railway.
Statements that are symbolic for Dinkel’s Pressig homeland.
Nowhere in the Franconian forest has a place been characterized by the railway so much.
This was the starting point for the steep mountain section to the north, which peaks in Steinbach am Wald following an ascension of about 220 meters.
Previously trains and locomotives housed in Pressig were needed to handle this.
In 1901 the Bavarian parliament approved the building of a depot with 21 locomotives, apprentice workshops, catenary and railroad maintenance division.
The centerpiece was the turntable, which after reconstruction in the year 1899 had a diameter of 18 metres, says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, a railway historian and a professional railroader with 47 years of experience.
The Pressig depot, which in the year 1968 was relocated to Bamberg, also operated locomotives for the branch lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben.
On July 15 1950 the "Volksblatt" reported of a staff of 160 men; 13 steam locomotives and eight electric locomotives were stationed in Pressig at that time.
The electrification of the track in 1939 reduced the need for pulling trains and locomotives.
From 1977 they were still used with freight trains.
By 1991 at least 10,000 wagons were shunted.
In 1982 the depot was partially dismantled and the remainder in the year 1991.
Heidrich: ‘It’s a shame that better use of the location is not envisaged, also with regard to freight traffic’.
Still in the year 1989 at Pentecost, the Nuremberg Railway Directorate celebrated "50 years of electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld" with a pompous station festival for the anniversary in Pressig.
10,000 enthusiastic spectators were here, remembers Georg Dinkel.
Shortly afterwards.
On June 1, 1991 the last 30 men were withdrawn and the Pressig marshalling yard was history.
The shunters and wheel scotches took care of the heaviest rail traffic work, remembers Dinkel.
Each mistake could have fatal consequences.
Why the Pressig-Rothenkirchen station led to a change in the hierarchy of both locations and how many more historical and current pictures there are, is included here in the infrankenPlus article.
Kerber with initial success at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round in the tennis tournament in Beijing, just as Julia Görges before.
Kerber won 6:2 at the China Open against Frenchwoman Kristina Mladenovic.
Next opponent of the world ranking third is either Julia Putinzewa from Kazakhstan or Carla Suárez Navarro from Spain.
Siegemund led 6-3, 4-2 against Daria Kassatkina, when the Russian athlete on rank 13 gave up.
The Swabian will now face Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
On the weekend as part of the "Art and Enjoyment" series, a special exhibition was opened in Mittelehrenbach.
Organisers and visitors showed great relief that the weather conditions were ideal for the special vernissage of the "Windspiel-Performance" which took place in the open air on the Dahlmann-Schmidt property in Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the umbrella of the tourism association "Rund ums Walberla" (Around Walberla) in the framework of the series "Art and Enjoyment".
This opened its doors for the 15th year.
The large number of visitors showed the fascination with the exhibits.
21 exhibits from 20 artists can now be viewed in Mittelehrenbach.
The host Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists at the opening of the exhibition.
He had been there from the first hour.
As has Volker Hahn, who has made a name for himself as the main organiser as well as an artist.
It was a little surprising when Hahn announced his retirement some days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer he put his task in experienced, young hands with excellent future prospects.
In the past, both have already been actively involved in the selection of artists and have helped in designing flyers.
Once again this year there will be a 70 cent special stamp designed on the occasion of Kunst & Genuss (art and enjoyment), available at every art station.
The poster this year ‘outdance the Betzn’, designed by Volker Hahn, can be purchased for eight euros.
Hahn enjoyed the excellent reception of the special exhibit.
It was possible to persuade Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg to provide musical framing.
The visitor quickly understands when walking through the spacious garden that the title "Windspiel-Performance" literally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it in a playful way.
There are metal or ceramic works of art, often accented with color.
Already at the entrance to the property, on the right side, the visitor is awaited by the "Glücksbaum" (luck tree) by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree stump, brightened with color, equipped with 20 pin wheels, 24 horseshoes and 24 aluminum tubes for a sound piece.
The sun shining through the bushes in the background adds a magical touch to the object, inviting visitors to linger.
Barbara Waschneck comes from Eckental and prefers to dedicate three-dimensional letters to the event 15 years K&G.
There are many parts moving in the wind.
Halfway through the path Siegrid Frey from Eckental exhibited her work "Der Wind das himmlische Kind" (The Wind the Heavenly Child).
At the end, Volker Hahn demonstrates his colorful fantasy created from clay, cement and stainless steel.
The ‘wind chime performance’ theme wanders through the multi-purpose art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be viewed until December 31, 2018.
50 years of MGV 68 Albachten: Singers celebrate 50th birthday
1968 - That was the time of the protest and the student movement.
And also the people of Albachten demonstrated their anger.
At least five of them.
In no case did they want to accept that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cäcilia" there would be no more singing life in the district.
It has become a legend by now: At a bank in Tinnenbusch, the MGV 68 came to existence.
That was 50 years ago.
Now there will be a big anniversary celebration in the “House of Encounter.”
It will be full today, senses chairman Jürgen Holstiege, and he was right.
There are 150 guests, a real success for the Albachten singer.
They had revived the foundation festival especially for the anniversary.
It was a tradition for years, and then there was a break for the first time.
The traditional festival was back again in time for the 50th anniversary.
It became an elegant ball and formal clothing had been requested beforehand.
Guests did not sit in rows as usual in the “House of Encounter,” but rather sat comfortably around tables.
In between, everyone could dance. DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln put on the controls and heated up the dance floor.
Of course, the singers of the MGV 68 Albachten would let their voices sound.
Matching the occasion, happy songs were quite fitting.
Almost set: "So ein Tag, so wunderschön wie heute."
There was also the “Rüdesheim wine” to go with the exquisite grape juice, which many guests had in front of them.
“Humulus lupulus,” which is the Latin name for ‘hops,’ references another cool drink.
The choir direction of Richard Homann, who is one of the five who were in Tinnenbusch back then, was once again very confident.
It's just fun to sing under his direction, said Holstiege. "He has such an easy way, he accomplishes a masterpiece every time.". By the way, this time not only men were presented vocally.
The ladies’ choir “High C” were also guests, whose repertoire above all includes evergreens from the 20s to the 60s.
To round it all off there was some poetry.
Singer Theo Weber sat at his desk until three in the morning to create his own rhymes.
And Andreas Winterhoff also presented melodic poetry.
There was also a big Tombola game.
The proceeds are to go towards financing the children of the Albatros Youth Center visiting the all-weather zoo.

Volleyball: Women's 3rd League: USC II wins high-class derby against BW Aasee
The promoted team marches on.
Three games, three wins - USC Münster's reserves, under the patronage of Axel Büring, gets on really well in league three.
No trace of shyness or getting the heebie-jeebies. The independents are doing their thing.
And with the 3-0 (25-15, 25-23, 26-24) against city rivals BW Aasee, they did really well.
It wasn't crystal clear, but we have already left an impression, says the reasonably satisfied coach.
BWA coach Kai Annacker immediately agreed with him: “This is a defeat that we can live with.
We are not dissatisfied.” Quite the contrary.
In the evening, at Ronja de Boer’s belated birthday party, the mood was good, the game was done.
Yes, the result is in fact an optical illusion.
In the third set, the guests had a set ball.
If you bring it to the finish, such a game can also tip over quite easily, Büring knows from years of experience.
Ultimately USC made everything clear with its experienced players and finished it out.
We all know who is on the other side in such a derby.
That was not our undoing.
I've seen a great game of volleyball at times, Annacker did not struggle with the 0-3 and went straight back to the agenda.
After just three matchdays, it does not seem foreseeable where the independents’ journey goes.
It’s simply too early for that, says Axel Büring.
He only feels vindicated in one thing: “The 3rd Women's League has an unbelievably good level of play.
It’s not even close with regional league volleyball.” They don't even want to look down towards the fourth league.
If they don’t want to lose hope, they have to look up.
But a conclusion can't be drawn until after ten or eleven games.
The next game is at Emlichheim on Saturday.
Aasee will compete in Essen on October 14.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller did not feel she was enough for her husband
The "Dream Ship" made Heide Keller a star.
Now she speaks openly that the series could have had some influence on her divorce with Hans von Borsody.
Heide Keller (76) became famous in her role as chief hostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the ‘Dream Boat’, but on 01 January 2018 she disembarked forever.
The series that made her a star might be one of the reasons of her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), to whom she had been married for ten years.
This could also have been a reason.
Because this work became a part of me, I traveled around the world with a suitcase alone and many of my admired colleagues treated me as equal, explained Keller in the interview to "Bild am Sonntag".
She used to be "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that had changed with the "Dream Ship".
Because now journalists called her only as Heide Keller.
I don’t know if he was happy with this.
She thinks that it possible that her husband might have been jealous at the time, but "as many men Hans was afraid of talking about problems and feelings."
Keller always made effort for Hans von Borsody "and he did not want to discover my fears and my weaknesses.
In plain language it means: I’m pretending," as she explains further.
She always had the feeling of ‘not being enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman, which actually I never was, even though I sometimes appeared cheeky and courageous on stage.
I wanted our love to last forever’.
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller said ‘Yes’ again, ‘although I was scared it could go wrong again’.
The day before the civil marriage, I sat in the changing room crying and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage to von Borsody failed as well.
Why did it never work out with men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller was in love at that time "as in the movie.
Unfortunately, this vision is not compatible with daily life.
I am too naive to approach love."
The moth, who regularly explores the city nightlife in the NZZ Zurich area, has now attempted this on the ZFF opening party.
Not really a moth, just a little shady.
And the shiny glare, in which a green carpet is bathed in, on the Sechseläutenplatz, blinds him over the charge.
It is the film festival though, where the more or less famous want to bathe in the spotlight.
So this late Thursday evening he tottered across the square, to briefly relieve himself in the "Aquaclean toilet oasis".
This is the name of the public toilet complex sponsored by a large sanitary company, which is being premiered at the festival: The public convenience on the ground floor of a new pavilion tries hard to create a luxurious ambience.
This evening, whatever the reason, it literally stinks in the gents area.
So out of here, over to the other side of the street: Invited guests, who were entertained at the best level at the cinema next door with the opening film "Green Book", like every year celebrate the opening of the festival with a party in the three-storey department store.
Its name fits perfectly with this film festival: It is well known that the works shown originate from the whole globe.
What do you have to come up with when writing an article about this festival, so as not to fall into hidden advertising for its 190 partner companies.
The moth binds a ribbon around the feelers that a fairy godmother has sent him, and two beefy doormen generously let him pass inside.
Inside, the invited are crowded together, they dance way past midnight to live music or accept rhythms dictated by the DJ, to which they shout at each other, and rinse exquisite appetizers down with a glass of champagne.
In the delicatessen in the basement oysters await slurping mouths, nearby the unparalleled Culatello di Zibello raw ham is freshly cut, and a chocolate fountain bubbles.
And the highlight is: that the shop shelves have not been cleared of the exclusive products for the event.
It has been like this for years and seems to function without any major losses.
You must just love the country for it!
The moth studies the sign by the escalator: "Please be careful on the escalator if you are wearing a long dress".
Should this be two separate instructions, he has ignored the dress code.
However, it is a conditional construction that has undoubtedly saved lives.
In the household goods department on the upper floor, the winged man tips down a cocktail made with espresso called "Golden Eye", which is suited to the festival award.
The mixture getting the prize for the best drink, presented by a capsule manufacturer - not compulsory.
And George Clooney, who has been advertising for the brand mentioned for years, is also not there on the evening.
There is one face, however, between local notables, cash desk and kitchenware, that is familiar to the spectators: Peter Farrelly, Director of the opening film.
Its main character will not be far away.
And in reality: Immediately, Viggo Mortensen, who is almost sixty walks through the crowd appearing almost like a choir boy.
He is not talked into, not gaped at, at the most he receives stealthy glances.
This restraint, easily mistaken for inhibition, is why the international stars love this film festival.

Handball: Association League 1: ASV Senden "devastated" after last-minute loss
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball club ASV Senden, could hardly believe it: "Such a bitter defeat.” His protégés were “devastated” after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) failure - the fourth in four games - Saturday evening at LIT Germania 2.
Over long periods, they had - as in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst - not played badly.
We only overslept the initial phase, said the ASV coach annoyed.
Quickly, the home team led with 8-1, also the early break, that Bieletzki had taken, did not pan out.
But then suddenly a jolt went through the team, summarized Bieletzki.
At halftime, they were only two goals behind.
Senden's best player, Marius Hintze, kept scoring in phase one.
After the change, things got even better from the visitors’ point of view.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst equalized for 15-15.
Four minutes before the alarm, the lead was still only three goals (29-26).
And then?
The impartial got in on the action.
